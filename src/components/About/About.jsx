        <h2>The Art Behind My Code</h2>
        <p>
          I carefully shape each detail with intention, aiming for timeless
          aesthetics, clear structure, and smooth user experience. This is where
          design meets discipline, and creativity becomes code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every website featured in this portfolio - from concept to final
          polish - is entirely my own work.
        </p>

        <h3>My Approach :</h3>
        <p>
          I don't just build websites. I craft digital experiences that feel
          intuitive, visually balanced, and performance-driven. I value clean
          code, scalable structure, and thoughtful interaction â€” every element
          serves a purpose.
